                    <h3>Software for lending tools</h3>
                    <p>
                        Who has this tool? Where is it? When is it due back? Is it ready to lend?
                        What is it costing to repair and clean? With the Lend Engine, itâ€™s easy to get the answers to these questions.
                        Track tool locations, note history, assign to team members, see the repair queue, and use barcodes to make check in and check out quick and simple.

                    <p>
                        You can store everything you need to know about your tools in the online database - accessible by anyone in your team, from anywhere.
                        Upload photos or attach files (perhaps safety procedures), and add custom fields which you can use to report on later.
