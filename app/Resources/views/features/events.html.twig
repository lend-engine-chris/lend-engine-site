    <p>If you run workshops, meetings, repair caf√©s or any other kind of event, you can use the Lend Engine to manage a calendar and event bookings.</p>

    <h3>Web based calendar</h3>
    <p>
        Your member site comes with a built in events calendar; events can tie in with your regular site opening hours
        so you can manage everything in one system. Allow pick up and drop off of items at events, too.
    </p>

    <h3>Online event booking</h3>
    <p>
        If you choose, you can allow people to book places on your events.
        Take payment by credit/debit card too, if your event has a cost.
        Manage event bookings and attendance in the same platform as your members, loans and memberships.
    </p>
