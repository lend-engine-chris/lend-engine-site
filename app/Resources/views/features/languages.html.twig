    <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Dutch</li>
        <li>French</li>
        <li>German</li>
        <li>Icelandic</li>
        <li>Slovak</li>
        <li>Welsh</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All plans allow you to choose a single language from the above list for your member site and automated emails.
        Our top tier plans allow you to display item information in your customer/member's choice of language;
    each customer can have a different language, within the choices you give them.</p>

    <p>If you'd like your members to view items, browse your site and receive automated emails in a language that's not
        listed, and you feel able to translate a few hundred words, just get in touch and we'll talk.</p>
