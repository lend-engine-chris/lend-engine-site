                        With flexible and powerful reporting, it's easy to see who's borrowing what, which items are popular, and which are not so popular.
                        Instantly see what items are out on loan, when they are due back, and what's overdue.

                        Use item, loan and member custom fields to filter your data in ways that suit your organisation.
                        Perhaps you want to show sponsors or donors how their items are being used,
                        or track loans by member region for funding applications.
