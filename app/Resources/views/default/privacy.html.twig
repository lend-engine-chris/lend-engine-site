                    <h3>Service Providers</h3>

                    <p>
                        We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the
                        Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our
                        Service is used.<br><br>

                        These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our
                        behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Card Payments</h3>


                    <p>
                        Credit and debit card payment services are provided directly by Stripe.com. At no point are card
                        details stored in Lend Engine, or transferred via Lend Engine servers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Security</h3>

                    <p>
                        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
                        its absolute security.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Links To Other Sites</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                        party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review
                        the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.<br><br>

                        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                        practices of any third party sites or services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").

                        We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you
                        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal
                        Information, please contact us. If we discover that a Children under 13 has provided us with
                        Personal Information, we will delete such information from our servers immediately.<br><br>

                        The exception to the above, in the case of Toy Libraries, is the capture of date of birth and
                        age of members’ children, which is provided with the consent of the guardian.
                    </p>
